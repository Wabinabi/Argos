Unresolved issues (NOT IMPORTANT/LOW/MED/HIGH/URGENT):
- LOW: When hiding pages, the close child window closes the program
- MED: "Browse" text window, change to side scroll when file directory is too long.
- HIGH: Closing the software fucks it up real bad lol
- HIGH: and Units indications somewhere on the 3D model
- URGENT: Update import to look for 
- HIGH: Chance camera preset to be striaght on or not
- MED: if recent files are the same then don't double list them
- LOW: the recent files doesn't update if you're to import more than once in a software. I.e., if the current file updates then the 
- URGENT: The 3D model doesn't pan or select points or zoom on initial implementation. Needs to have stuff clicked prior to working with full functionality
- MED: Dynamic scaling

===========================================================
Usability Feature Improvements:

- [ ] Selection of folder instead of files when selecting a folder to import.
  - [ ] Not too hard but needs to find a definition

- [ ] Pop up of multiple Import has been successful message boxes when opening the cloud file.
  - [ ] this is a weird bug to fix

- [ ] Units on graphs.
- [ ] 3D manipulation panning capability.
- [ ] Formatting for trip details to better draw the eye.
  - [ ] probably some sort of thing similar to… the drone details will take some time

- [ ] Amount of points generated for the 3D map was expected to be within the 3D cloud widget themselves.
- [ ] Pop up to indicate to the user that the drone details had been saved. ==XS==
- [x] Option to revert drone details to  default values? ==S==
- [ ] Implement widget focus to allow multiple windows be open and active at once.==XL==
- [x] Placement of the Export function.   Next to the import function?   In the 3D point cloud widget?  Multiple export buttons? ==S==
- [ ] Saving settings for the 3D model view.
- [ ] Fix checkboxes for the 3D model view.
- [ ] Drop down box for font selection. ==S==
- [ ] Remove toggle button from the 3D model view.
- [ ] Loading time between switching graphs?
- [ ] Additional tool tips and help. ==S==
- [ ] Time series playback?
- [ ] Flight path depiction.
- [ ] Some of the fonts are too hard to see.
- [ ] Drone details resize and add scroll capability.

What Mink is working on now:
- source the data from the vector point instead of text file (altitude, no. of points, throttle, no. of events)

- informEvents
- verboseEvents
-emergencyEvents

QVector<DroneEvent> emergencyEvents;


What Mink is working on next:
-------------------------------
- Drone diagnostics (flight time needs to updated with each export)
- delete "temp files" at software close
- Save feature (diags and ply get saved)
- update open feature to open the saved file format
- Fix all the bugs
- Deal with exceptions (you're literally doing smack all) e.g. file does not exist
-------------------------------

Side thoughts:
- In the 3D model, the different colour options can support colour blindess/ night time/blue light
- 3D model: flight path
- 3D model: add time function to cloud points. Time recorded to x,y,z
- 3D model: add filter function, hide points that fall outside of selected time frame
- Recent Files: refer to how VS code does this. Drop down/hide capacity for Today/This Month/Older
- open multiple trip datas
- TEMP FILES: Only PLY is to be saved as temp, the rest are to be saved in-memory as vectors!

Mink's resources
- Read all files from a selected directory (for the base log) https://forum.qt.io/topic/64817/how-to-read-all-files-from-a-selected-directory-and-use-them-one-by-one
- Find file and replace, https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwidgets-dialogs-findfiles-example.html

Recent files:
- the "update recent Files action needs to be called whenever something is imported
- imported should be called when opened in menu drop down or whatever


===========STUFF THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED RECENTLY===================
- When "import" is hit, a PLY file needs to be generated. 
- completing all the dummy buttons
- display an embedded 2D plot on the Trip Data page
- change 2D plot x scale to time (instead of date)
