Unresolved issues (NOT IMPORTANT/LOW/MED/HIGH/URGENT):
- LOW: When hiding pages, the close child window closes the program
- 


What Mink is working on now:
- display 3D model within the DATAmodel.cpp




Side thoughts:
- In the 3D model, the different colour options can support colour blindess/ night time/blue light
- 3D model: flight path
- 3D model: add time function to cloud points. Time recorded to x,y,z
- 3D model: add filter function, hide points that fall outside of selected time frame
