Unresolved issues (NOT IMPORTANT/LOW/MED/HIGH/URGENT):

- MED: "Browse" text window, change to side scroll when file directory is too long.
- MED: Dynamic scaling

===========================================================
Usability Feature Improvements:

- [x] Selection of folder instead of files when selecting a folder to import. ==M==
  - [x] Not too hard but needs to find a definition

- [x] Pop up of multiple Import has been successful message boxes when opening the cloud file.

- [x] Units on graphs. ==XS==
- [x] 3D manipulation panning capability. 
  - [x] Not possible in Qt due to 3D scatter plot limitations

- [x] Formatting for trip details to better draw the eye. ==M==
  - [x] probably some sort of thing similar to… the drone details will take some time

- [ ] Amount of points generated for the 3D map was expected to be within the 3D cloud widget themselves. ==XS==
- [x] Pop up to indicate to the user that the drone details had been saved. ==XS==
- [x] Option to revert drone details to  default values? ==S==
- [x] Implement widget focus to allow multiple windows be open and active at once.==XL==
- [x] Placement of the Export function.   Next to the import function?   In the 3D point cloud widget?  Multiple export buttons? ==S==
- [ ] Saving settings for the 3D model view.
- [ ] Fix checkboxes for the 3D model view.
- [x] Drop down box for font selection. ==S==
  - [ ] Already implemented, but icon not visible? Weird

- [x] Remove toggle button from the 3D model view.
- [ ] Loading time between switching graphs?
- [ ] Additional tool tips and help. ==S==
- [ ] Time series playback?
- [ ] Flight path depiction.
- [ ] Some of the fonts are too hard to see.
- [x] Drone details resize and add scroll capability.

===========================================================
High priority:
- [x] Bold running drone stats categories
- [x] Link actual Github in help
- [x] Cursor messaging
- [ ] 2D graphs events
	- Clickable 2D points for events
	- zoom and scroll on 2D graphs
- [x] Don't allow "View Trip Data" if nothing is imported
- [x] Indicate if data is missing (investigate throttle missing)
- [ ] Naming conventions + commenting consistency
	- [ ] Document purpose
- [ ] .exe installation

weird throttle bug with importing data more than once!!!

Side thoughts:
- In the 3D model, the different colour options can support colour blindess/ night time/blue light
- 3D model: flight path
- 3D model: add time function to cloud points. Time recorded to x,y,z
- 3D model: add filter function, hide points that fall outside of selected time frame
- Recent Files: refer to how VS code does this. Drop down/hide capacity for Today/This Month/Older
- Open multiple trip datas
- TEMP FILES: Only PLY is to be saved as temp, the rest are to be saved in-memory as vectors!

Mink's resources
- Read all files from a selected directory (for the base log) https://forum.qt.io/topic/64817/how-to-read-all-files-from-a-selected-directory-and-use-them-one-by-one
- Find file and replace, https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwidgets-dialogs-findfiles-example.html

Recent files:
- the "update recent Files action needs to be called whenever something is imported
- imported should be called when opened in menu drop down or whatever
