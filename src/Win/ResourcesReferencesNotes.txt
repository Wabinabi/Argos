Unresolved issues (NOT IMPORTANT/LOW/MED/HIGH/URGENT):
- LOW: When hiding pages, the close child window closes the program
- MED: "Browse" text window, change to side scroll when file directory is too long.
- HIGH: Closing the software fucks it up real bad lol
- HIGH: and Units indications somewhere on the 3D model
- URGENT: Update import to look for 
- HIGH: Chance camera preset to be striaght on or not
- MED: if recent files are the same then don't double list them
- LOW: the recent files doesn't update if you're to import more than once in a software. I.e., if the current file updates then the 
- URGENT: The 3D model doesn't pan or select points or zoom on initial implementation. Needs to have stuff clicked prior to working with full functionality
- MED: Dynamic scaling

===========================================================
Jimmy - please help! Ordered in priority...
x Create sample data folder as per discussion (as7.log, data,csv, as7.config)
   -> Done! Data under DATA/SAMPLE_DATA for the respective SD cards. There's also a NOT_README file with details on the features of each

- Start writing the code that identifies events (struct that associates the time log with it)
   -> Events identified but they're not being used 

- Running stats (when file is imported, check whether this flight no. has been imported previously. If not, update total flight time and no. of trips, is this is the largest flight no. also update "most recent flight")
   -> currently working on, part of information storage

- Dynamic drone specs textboxes in a window
   -> LATER

- Create text file with drone specs as per discussion
   -> LATER

Things that need to be done:

* Importing B1's code in


===========================================================
What Mink is working on now:
- completing all the dummy buttons


What Mink is working on next:
-------------------------------
- Drone diagnostics (flight time needs to updated with each export)
- UI theme development 
- delete "temp files" at software close
- Save feature (diags and ply get saved)
- update open feature to open the saved file format
- Fix all the bugs
- Deal with exceptions (you're literally doing smack all) e.g. file does not exist
-------------------------------

Side thoughts:
- In the 3D model, the different colour options can support colour blindess/ night time/blue light
- 3D model: flight path
- 3D model: add time function to cloud points. Time recorded to x,y,z
- 3D model: add filter function, hide points that fall outside of selected time frame
- Recent Files: refer to how VS code does this. Drop down/hide capacity for Today/This Month/Older
- open multiple trip datas
- TEMP FILES: Only PLY is to be saved as temp, the rest are to be saved in-memory as vectors!

Mink's resources
- Read all files from a selected directory (for the base log) https://forum.qt.io/topic/64817/how-to-read-all-files-from-a-selected-directory-and-use-them-one-by-one
- Find file and replace, https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtwidgets-dialogs-findfiles-example.html

Recent files:
- the "update recent Files action needs to be called whenever something is imported
- imported should be called when opened in menu drop down or whatever


===========STUFF THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED RECENTLY===================
- Destroy temp files when closing
- Copy PLY files over to temp PLY file
- read model from the temp file
- When "import" is hit, a PLY file needs to be generated.
