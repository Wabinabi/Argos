Unresolved issues (NOT IMPORTANT/LOW/MED/HIGH/URGENT):
- LOW: When hiding pages, the close child window closes the program
- MED: "Browse" text window, change to side scroll when file directory is too long.


What Mink is working on now:
- Finalise software wire frame with dummy buttons and boxes
What Mink is working on next:
- Read file from Datamodel.cpp



Side thoughts:
- In the 3D model, the different colour options can support colour blindess/ night time/blue light
- 3D model: flight path
- 3D model: add time function to cloud points. Time recorded to x,y,z
- 3D model: add filter function, hide points that fall outside of selected time frame
- Recent Files: refer to how VS code does this. Drop down/hide capacity for Today/This Month/Older


===========STUFF THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED===================
- Display 3D model within the DATAmodel.cpp
- Browse for file (only can select txt)
- Import file to Vector string. Which calls browse if there's no directory provided.

=================MINK'S RANDO NOTES========================
- Wire frame: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HZjIMIIsOeRHFitesahdV5oPBWg40f4h/view?usp=sharing
- Read all files from a selected directory (for the base log) https://forum.qt.io/topic/64817/how-to-read-all-files-from-a-selected-directory-and-use-them-one-by-one
