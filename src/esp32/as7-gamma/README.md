# Argous S7: Autonomous Mine Surveying Drone

The Argous S7 (AS7) Project is the design and implementation of an autonomous mine surveying drone for a Swinburne University Final Year Project.

## Outline

The AS7 project contains two parts: the on-board and off-board software The on-board software is loaded onto the ESP32 and is responsible for the main control and collection of data. The off-board software runs on Windows 10 and provides data visualisation and diagnostics for the drone.

* On-board software can be found under `src/esp32`
* Off-board software can be found under `src/win10`
* ArduPilot configuration can be found under `src/ardupilot`



==This section mostly focuses on what details are where==

* This document goes through install
* The other two go through user and more details
