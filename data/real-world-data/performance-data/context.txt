One Dimensional Tests + Spin Test

Spin tests demonstrate compass accuracy in relation to using the US sensors to map a room

Comments from Josh, who evaluated the data:

- the 1d test is rly good to show off measurements
- the spin tests should produce recentagular shapes (mostly) if the data points are all set to a position of 0,0,0
